# Python Challenge

This repository houses scripts for two different things: **PyBank** and **PyPoll**.

## PyBank

PyBank is a Python script that analyzes financial records to calculate and display key financial metrics of a dataset, including the total number of months in the dataset, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, the average change in "Profit/Losses" between months, and the greatest increase and decrease in profits with their corresponding months. The script reads financial data from a CSV file, performs the analysis, prints the results to the terminal, and exports the analysis to a text file.

### Instructions to Run:

- Navigate to the `PyBank` directory
- Ensure `budget_data.csv` is in the `Resources` folder.
- Ensure the folder `analysis` exists.
- Run the `main.py` script.
- The analysis will be printed to the terminal, and the results will be exported to a text file named `financial_analysis.txt` in the `analysis` folder.

## PyPoll

PyPoll is a Python script that analyzes poll data to determine the winner of an election based on the popular vote. The script reads election data from a CSV file, processes the votes, calculates the percentage of votes each candidate won, and identifies the candidate with the highest number of votes as the winner. It prints the election results to the terminal and exports the analysis to a text file.

### Instructions to Run:

- Navigate to the `PyBank` directory
- Ensure `election_data.csv` is in the `Resources` folder.
- Ensure the folder `analysis` exists.
- Run the `main.py` script.
- The analysis will be printed to the terminal, and the results will be exported to a text file named `election_results.txt` in the `analysis` folder.
